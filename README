RLSD, the Retro Linux-libre Software Distribution, is a small, "live" operating
system with GNU/Linux-libre (http://linux-libre.fsfla.org/) and retro
applications for the x86 and x86_64 architectures.

This is the development version of RLSD 2.x. It provides a smarter, simpler and
faster build system designed for native building, without a cross-compiler. In
addition, it introduces new security features.

RLSD consists of free software: software that respects the user's freedom. RLSD
is free to study, modify and share. To read more about free software, see
http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html.

For more information, see the project homepage (http://rlsd.dimakrasner.com/).

Building
========

RLSD is built from source. It can be cross-compiled through any Debian
(http://www.debian.org/) based distribution.

To build RLSD, install the following packages:
  build-essential autoconf automake autotools-dev autoconf-archive unzip flex
  bison git nasm squashfs-tools pkg-config file subversion bc dosfstools yasm
  libarchive-dev libcurl4-gnutls-dev xorriso wget
  liblwp-useragent-determined-perl advancecomp optipng curl gawk clzip libtool \
  mercurial

Then, switch to the RLSD directory and run:
  ./scripts/build_all
