Building
========

RLSD is built from source and cross-compiled through Trisquel
(http://www.trisquel.info/).

To build RLSD:
  - Install QEMU (http://www.qemu.org/) and Packer (https://www.packer.io/)
  - Set up the build environment in a VM:
      cd packer/; packer build packer.json
  - Start the VM
  - Inside it:
      cd rlsd; ./scripts/build_all
