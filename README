RLSD, the Retro Linux-libre Software Distribution, is a small, "live" operating
system with GNU/Linux-libre (http://linux-libre.fsfla.org/), for the x86 and
x86_64 architectures.

RLSD consists of free software: software that respects the user's freedom. RLSD
is free to study, modify and share. To read more about free software, see
http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html.

For more information, see the project homepage (http://rlsd2.dimakrasner.com/).

This is an automated build system that builds RLSD and its entire package
repository from source, through Trisquel (http://www.trisquel.info/). The
process of setting up a build environment is automated as well.

Building
========

To build RLSD:
  - Install QEMU (http://www.qemu.org/) and Packer (https://www.packer.io/)
  - Set up the build environment in a VM:
      cd packer/; packer build packer-x86_64.json
    or:
      cd packer/; packer build packer-x86.json
  - Start the VM:
      qemu-system-x86_64 -m 4096 -hda x86_64/rlsd.qcow2 -enable-kvm
    or:
      qemu-system-i386 -cpu pentium2 -m 4096 -hda x86/rlsd.qcow2 -enable-kvm
  - Inside it:
      cd rlsd; ./scripts/build_all
