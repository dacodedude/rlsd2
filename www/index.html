		<h1>RLSD</h1>
		<h2>Overview</h2>
		<p>Welcome! You've reached the home of RLSD, the Retro <a href="http://linux-libre.fsfla.org/" target="_blank">Linux-libre</a> Software Distribution.</p>
		<p>RLSD is an extremely minimalistic, small, lightweight and security-hardened, <a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html" target="_blank">free</a>, text operating system for x86 and x86_64. It's a unique <a href="http://www.gnu.org/" target="_blank">GNU</a>/<a href="http://linux-libre.fsfla.org/" target="_blank">Linux-libre</a> distribution that provides a selection of console applications and home-grown security features which might appeal to hackers.</p>
		<p>In RLSD:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>The user always runs as root</li>
			<li>The root user is called "boss"</li>
			<li>Everything is linked statically and the kernel is 100% monolithic</li>
			<li>The file system layout is extremely simple: all executables go to /bin, man pages to /man, etc'</li>
			<li>Package management is simple and fast, thanks to <a href="https://github.com/dimkr/packlim" target="_blank">packlim</a></li>
			<li>Packages are small; for example, the C library is <a href="http://www.musl-libc.org/" target="_blank">musl</a> and the shell is <a href="https://github.com/dimkr/loksh" target="_blank">loksh</a></li>
			<li><a href="https://github.com/dimkr/luufs" target="_blank">luufs</a> prevents malware from tampering with the operating system core</li>
			<li><a href="https://github.com/dimkr/logfence" target="_blank">logfence</a> prevents modification of logs</li>
			<li><a href="https://github.com/dimkr/elfence" target="_blank">elfence</a> prevents the execution of untrusted applications</li>
			<li>A kernel security module ensures executables run only from /bin and blocks malware-like activity (e.g mprotect() with PROT_EXEC)</li>
			<li>The user is trapped in a container, to protect critical system daemons</li>
			<li>Critical daemons run in a private mounts namespace, to prevent mount-based attacks</li>
			<li>The operating system core is a digitally-signed image</li>
			<li>All security features can be disabled by passing "secure=0" to the kernel, but that requires reboot</li>
			<li>Copy-paste using the mouse works and handled by <a href="http://www.nico.schottelius.org/software/gpm/" target="_blank">gpm</a></li>
			<li>The console color scheme is randomly generated at boot time</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Downloads</h2>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="/images">ISO images</a>, with support for dd</li>
			<li><a href="/repo">Binary packages</a>, via the repository</li>
			<li><a href="/sources">Source code</a> for all packages</li>
			<li><a href="/logs">Build logs</a> for all packages</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Usage</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Use ifconfig, dhcpcd, iw, wpa_passhprase and wpa_supplicant to set up a network connection</li>
			<li>Use packlim to install packages</li>
			<li>Use man to obtain documentation</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Development</h2>
		<p>Most of RLSD's development is automated, to ease its development; for example, package updates are monitored <a href="/updates.log">here</a> and the entire package repository is built automatically. To build your own version of RLSD or contribute, clone its <a href="git://rlsd2.dimakrasner.com/" target="_blank">code repository</a> and follow the documentation.</p>
		<p>If you encounter a crash, please send the crashing executable from /bin and the crash dump from /run/crash. Thank you.</p>
